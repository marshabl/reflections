What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

    When you initialize a repository, it creates a system for you to use git and its version control capabilities.
    We need it to start the version control capabilities.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

    Staging area is a place where you can place file(s) that will be committed into a new repository. Working directory shows what files you are looking at.
    They both add a lot of value by creating a process to organize your work.
