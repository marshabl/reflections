When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

    You can use a remote repository when you are working on a project with multiple people.
    Especially if people are working from different locations. It is like storing things in the cloud and being able to access
    them from anywhere.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    You want to pull changes manually because you want to decide when the project is at a stage that is ready to share with the public or other people you are working with.
    If you share prior to a logical stopping point, other developers could get very confused by your work.
